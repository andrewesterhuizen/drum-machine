## Drum Machine

This project is my first attempt at building an application related to music making which is something I am very interested in. My idea was to build a simple drum machine with a step sequencer that runs in the browser. I used the P5.js sound library for loading and playing the audio samples and React for the user interface and managing the drum machine's state.

I plan to expand this project into something a lot more configurable by using some of the P5 sound library's deeper features for manipulating audio and hopefully turn this project into something that has some real world use for making music.

### Tools used: 

- React for the UI and state management
- P5.js sound library for audio samples

### Features I plan on adding:

- different drum kits
- adding custom samples
- some controls for manipulating the sample pitch and volume envelope
- saving of patterns
- switching between patterns
